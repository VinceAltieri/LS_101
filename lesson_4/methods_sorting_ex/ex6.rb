What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

# Here we are chaining two methods together, the return value should be 11.
# First we call pop on this array, which returns 'caterpillar', then we are
# calling size on the length of that string which is 11.
